Quantifiers are adjectives and adjectival phrases that give approximate or specific answers to the questions `How much?` and `How many?`.

> _Sorry, but there isn’t **much** left for you to do here._

To answer the questions `How much?` and `How many?` certain quantifiers can be used with countable nouns (chairs, apples), while others can be used with uncountable nouns (tea, money).

> - _How **many** cousins do you have?_ (countable)
> - _How **much** money did you spend?_ (uncountable)

Note that `how much` can also be used when we want to know the price of something. In this case, we can use `how much` with countable nouns (both singular and plural nouns).

> _How **much** does this dress cost?_

`A few`, `a little`, (very) `few`, and (very) `little` are generally used in affirmative statements, not negatives or questions.

Look at the following table demonstrating the differences between a few, a little, (very) few, and (very) little.
