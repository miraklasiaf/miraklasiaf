We use `much` with uncountable nouns and `many` with countable nouns. Note that much and many are mainly used in interrogative and negative sentences.

> - _How **many** cousins do you have?_ (countable)
> - _How **much** money did you spend?_ (uncountable)

Note that `how much` can also be used when we want to know the price of something. In this case, we can use `how much` with countable nouns (both singular and plural nouns).

> _How **much** does this dress cost?_

`Much` and `many` can be used in affirmative sentences in combination with `too` and `so`. In this case, they denote the excessive amount of something.

> - _I donâ€™t know what to do with **so much sugar**!_
> - _There are **too many people** in here._
