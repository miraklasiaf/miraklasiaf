An object is **the person or thing that receives the action** in the clause or sentence. An object pronoun is a pronoun that takes the place of a noun as the object of sentence. For example:

> _She told **me** about her worries_

The word me is an object pronoun because it refers to person that is receiving the action.

> Note that object pronoun comes after a verb or a preposition

Object pronouns are used to replace nouns that are the direct or indirect object of a clause. Study the following table:

| Subject | Object |
| :-----: | :----: |
|   _I_   |  _me_  |
|  _you_  | _you_  |
|  _he_   | _him_  |
|  _she_  | _her_  |
|  _it_   |  _it_  |
|  _we_   |  _us_  |
| _they_  | _them_ |

Object pronouns come either after a verb or a preposition.

> _Ethan asked **me** to talk to **them**_

Note that the subject pronoun `it` and the object pronoun `it` look the same.

> - _Do you know the movie 'Pretty Lady'? **It** is my favourite!_ (subject pronoun)
> - _I've seen **it** many times._ (object pronoun)

Remember that object nouns are always the recipients of the action in sentences.

> - _~~He and me went to the movies~~. **He and I** went to the movies_.
> - _~~Mrs. Keith called her and I~~. Mrs. Keith called **her** and **me**_.

We should replace the object with an object pronoun to avoid repetition.

> _I can't stop thinking about Amy. ~~I can't stop imagining my future with Amy~~. I can't stop imagining my future with **her**_

## Guided Practice

**Use object pronouns to replace nouns that are the direct or indirect object of a clause.**

- I - .................... <InfoTooltip label='me' />
- you - .................... <InfoTooltip label='you' />
- he - .................... <InfoTooltip label='him' />
- she - .................... <InfoTooltip label='her' />
- it - .................... <InfoTooltip label='it' />
- we - .................... <InfoTooltip label='us' />
- they - .................... <InfoTooltip label='them' />

**Object pronouns come either after a verb or a preposition.**

- My mom asked (I) ................ <InfoTooltip label='me' /> to do (it) ................ <InfoTooltip label='it' />

**The subject pronoun _it_ and the object pronoun _it_ look the same.**

- I like this book a lot. **It** is one of my favourites. <InfoTooltip label='subject pronoun' />
- I often read **it** when I'm feeling down. <InfoTooltip label='object pronoun' />

**Object nouns are always the recipients of the action in sentences.**

- John invited them and I to his party. <InfoTooltip label='John invited them and me to his party.' />

**We should replace the object with an object pronoun to avoid repetition.**

- You can't talk with Greg every hour. Constantly being on the phone with Greg leaves you with zero free time. <InfoTooltip label='Contstantly being on the phone with him leaves you with zero free time.' />
