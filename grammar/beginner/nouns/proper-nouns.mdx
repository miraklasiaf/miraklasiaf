A proper noun is a noun that refers to a unique thing, such as (names, names of cities, planets, corporations etc.).

> _**London** is the capital of **Great Britain**_

**Note** that proper nouns are unique names. They are capitalized.

> _**Olivia** wants to travel around **Europe** next year_

We should also capitalize:

- Festivals

  > _**Christmas** and **Thanksgiving** are my two favourite holidays!_

- People's titles

  > _Everything depends on **President** Trump and his decisions._

- The names of books, films, plays, and paintings. We use capital letters for the nouns, adjectives, and verbs in the titles

  > _I've just finished reading '**The Old Man and the Sea**'._

Sometimes we use a person's name to refer to something they have created.

- _We were listening to **Mozart** the other day._
- _I'm reading **an Iris Murdoch** now._

When you use a word about a family member (e.g. mom, dad, uncle), capitalize it only if the word is being used exactly as you would use a name, i.e. if you were addressing the person directly. If the word is not being used as a name, it is not capitalized.

- _Please ask **Dad** if he can buy wine on his way home._
- Is your **dad** coming over for dinner?

Whenever you see a capitalized word, question whether or not it is a proper noun. Make sure that the capitalized word is in fact a noun as there are also proper adjectives.

- _**Asia** is one of the continents of the world._ (proper noun)
- _I don't really like **Asian** food._ (proper adjective)
