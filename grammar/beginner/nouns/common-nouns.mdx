A noun is a word used to identify people, places, or things (common noun), or to name a particular one of these (proper noun). For example:

> _You can buy **coffee** at **Starbucks**_

Coffee is a common noun. It is a word used to identify a thing. Starbucks on the other hand is a proper noun, because it is used to identify particular place.

A common noun is a noun showing a class of objects or a concept as opposed to a particular individual.

> _There was a **sofa**, two **chairs**, and a **wardrobe** in the **room**_

Note that common nouns are _general_ names. They are not capitalized unless they begin a sentence or are part of a title

> _**Capitals** of the countries are usually very large cities_

> _London is the **capital** of Great Britain_

Most of the time, we add `-s` to singular nouns to indicate plurality

- flower → _flower**s**_
- dogs → _dog**s**_

If the singular noun ends in `-s`, `-ss`, `-ch`, `-x`, `-z`, `-o`, add `-es` to make it plural.

- bus → _bus**es**_
- watch → _watch**es**_
- box → _box**es**_
- potato → _potato**es**_

If the singular noun ends in `-y`, change `-y` into `-i` and add `-es` to make it plural.

- baby → _bab**ies**_

If the singular noun ends in `-f` or `-fe`, `-f` is often changed to `-ve` before adding `-s` to make it plural.

- life → _li**ves**_
- wolf → _wol**ves**_ (but: belief → _belief**s**_ , chef → _chef**s**_ )

Some nouns do not follow any of the rules explained earlier. They are irregular. Here are the
most common irregular nouns.

| Singular |   Plural   |
| :------: | :--------: |
|  _man_   |   _men_    |
| _woman_  |  _women_   |
| _person_ |  _people_  |
| _child_  | _children_ |
| _tooth_  |  _teeth_   |
|  _foot_  |   _feet_   |
| _mouse_  |   _mice_   |
