Demonstratives are words that show which person or thing is being referred to.

> _**This** is Hugh, and **that** is Kevin_

Demonstratives show where an object, event, or person is in relation to the speaker. They can refer to a physical or a psychological closeness or distance.

|                                                   | Near the speaker | Far from the speaker |
| :------------------------------------------------ | :--------------: | :------------------: |
| Adverbs                                           |      _here_      |       _there_        |
| Demonstrative with singular and uncountable nouns |      _this_      |        _that_        |
| Demonstrative with plural countable nouns         |     _these_      |       _those_        |

Demonstratives can be placed before the noun or the adjective that modifies the noun.

> - _**That old man** stole my purse!_
> - _**These oranges** are delicious!_

Demonstratives can also appear before a number by itself when the noun is understood from the context.

> _I'll take **this one**, please._ = _I'll take this watermelon, please._

Demonstratives can be used by themselves when the noun they modify is understood from the context.

> _**Those** aren't yours. Put them back._ = _Those shoes aren't yours. Put them back._

When talking about events, the near demonstratives are often used to refer to the present while the far demonstratives often refer to the past.

> - _**This situation** is quite unstable._
> - _**That event** made me realise how important my family is to me._
