Limiting adjectives help to define or 'limit' a noun or pronoun by telling which one, what kind, or how many.

> _This sandwich is delicious._

In the category of limiting adjectives there are possesive adjectives. Possesive adjectives modify the noun following it in order to show possession. These adjectives are `my`, `your`, `his`, `her`, `its`, `our`, `their`.

> _I told **my** friend that I like someone, then she told that to **her** friend, and that friend told that to **his** friends, and now everyone knows everything._

Here is a table to help you learn which possessive adjective to us.

|    Person    | Subject | Object | Possessive Adjective | Possessive Pronoun |
| :----------: | :-----: | :----: | :------------------: | :----------------: |
| 1st Singular |    I    |   me   |       my (cat)       |        mine        |
| 2nd Singular |   You   |  you   |      your (cat)      |       yours        |
| 3rd Singular |   He    |  him   |      his (cat)       |        his         |
|              |   She   |  her   |      her (cat)       |        hers        |
|              |   It    |   it   |      its (cat)       |        its         |
|  1st Plural  |   We    |   us   |      our (cat)       |        ours        |
|  2nd Plural  |   You   |  you   |      your (cat)      |       yours        |
|  3rd Plural  |  They   |  them  |     their (cat)      |       theirs       |

The possessive adjective needs to agree with the possessor and not with the thing that is possessed. However, the verb that is used needs to be in agreement with the noun - if the noun is singular then the verb is singular; if the noun is plural then the verb is plural.

> - _She has a boyfriend. **Her** boyfriend is very kind._
> - _Peter likes to cook. **His** cook skills are great._

Possessive adjectives are often confused with possesive pronouns. A possesive adjective is used to describe a noun, and it comes before it. On the other hand, a possesive pronoun is used instead of a noun.

> - _**Your** car is black. (Your is an adjective which modifies the word 'car')_
> - _**Mine** is white. (Mine is a pronoun which functions as the subject of the sentence.)_

Do not confuse `its` and `it's`. `Its` is the possesive adjective for `it`. `It's` is a contraction of `it is`.

> - _**It is** a beautiful day._ (=It's a beautiful day.)
> - _The dog was wiggling **its** tail._

Do not confuse `their` and `they're`. `Their` is the possesive adjective for `they`. `They're` is a contraction of `they are`.

> - _**They are** best friends._ (=They're best friends.)
> - _I wanted to see **their** performance._
