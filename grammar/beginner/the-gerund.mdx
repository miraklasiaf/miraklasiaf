The gerund looks exactly the same as the present participle but the gerund always has the same function as a noun (although it looks like a verb).

> _**Cooking at home** can help you save a lot of money._

The gerund is a noun made from a verb by adding -_ing_.

Verbs ending in -_e_ drop -_e_ and add -_ing_.

> - make → _making_
> - write → _writing_

Verbs with one syllable, ending in one vowel and one consonant, double the consonant and add -_ing_.

> - knit → _knitting_
> - swim → _swimming_

Verbs ending -_ie_ change -_ie_ to -_y_ and add -_ing_.

> - lie → _lying_
> - die → _dying_

The gerund can be made negative by adding not.

> _The best thing for your health is not smoking._

The gerund can function as:

a. **the subject of the sentence**

> - _**Smoking** causes lung cancer._
> - _**Flying** makes him anxious._

b. **the complement of the verb `to be`**

> - _One of her duties was **writing weekly reports.**_
> - _The hardest thing about learning Russian is **memorizing the verbs of movement.**_

The gerund can be used:

a. **after prepositions or as part of certain expressions** (_there's no point in, in spite of etc_.)

> - _Can your brother count to ten **without looking** at his fingers?_
> - _**There's no point in** going back to his place now._

b. **after phrasal verbs**. They are composed of `a verb` + `preposition`/`adverb`

> - _I **ended up buying** a new computer._
> - _Rachel **gave up drinking** sugar drinks._
