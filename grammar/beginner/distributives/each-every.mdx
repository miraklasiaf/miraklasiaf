The distributives `each` and `every` are both related to describing members of a group. These distributives can only be used with **countable nouns** by being placed before the nouns. In many cases, they are interchangeable but there is a subtle difference between them.

> - _**Each** person is unique._
> - _**Every** person is unique._

## Distributive Each

`Each` is used to describe and highlight an individual member of a group, or multiple individuals. By using `each` you recognise the item is a part of a group, but that it also needs to be pointed out as a singular item too.

> _**Each book** on the shelf had a unique cover_

`Each` can be used with plural nouns and pronouns but must be followed by `of`.

> _**Each of the pupils** received a Christmas card._

`Each` can be used after the subject or at the end of a sentence.

> - _**My siblings each** have their own room._
> - _My mother gave my sister and I £20 **each**. (=gave £20 to each of us.)_

## Distributive Every

`Every` by constrast is a way of referring to the group as a collection of individual members. `Every` cannot be used with plural nouns

> _~~Every boys in my class wanted that computer game.~~ **Every boy** in my class wanted that computer game. _

`Every` can express different points in a series, especially with time expressions.

> - _**Every** morning Phillip goes for a run._
> - _And **every time** Ann would forgive him._

## Guided Practice

**Use _each_ to describe and highlight an individual member of a group. By using _each_ you recognise the item is a part of a group, but that it also needs to be pointed out as singular item too.**

- .......... contestant had something special about them. <InfoTooltip label="Each" />

**_Each_ can be used with plural nouns and pronouns but must be followed by of.**

- .......... us wanted to volunteer for the project. And .......... the members filled in the application form. <InfoTooltip label="Each of, each of" />

**_Each_ can be used after the subject or at the end of a sentence.**

- My parents .......... have their own car. <InfoTooltip label="each" />
- I bought three pairs of shoes £20 .......... . (=each pair of shoes cost £20) <InfoTooltip label="each" />

**_Every_ is a way of referring to the group as a collection of individual members. _Every_ cannot be used with plural nouns.**

- ~~Every people want to live a happy live~~. .................... wants to live a happy life. <InfoTooltip label="Every person" />

**_Every_ can express different points in a series, especially with time expressions.**

- .......... time I say something my brother gets annoyed. <InfoTooltip label="Every" />

## Short Story using Distributives Each - Every

-_Have you heard of Crystal's upcoming wedding? They are throwing a huge party with 300 guests invited._

-_That's a lot of people!_

-_Yeah, and **each of the guests** received a handwritten invitation. Could you believe that?_

-_Maybe they wanted **everyone** to feel welcomed._

-_I could have never done something like that! That's just insane and sounds like a total waste of time._

-_Well, **to each his own**, I suppose._

## Independent Practice

**Fill in the gaps with _each_ or _every_.**

1. My two sisters .......... have their own business. <InfoTooltip label="each" />
2. I live with a roommate, so we are paying £500 ........... <InfoTooltip label="each" />
3. .......... of the board directors signed the papers. <InfoTooltip label="Each" />
4. Stop being so judgemental! As they say, to .......... his own. <InfoTooltip label="each" />
5. .......... day I read 20 pages of a book. <InfoTooltip label="(Both variants are possible, though every is used more often.)" />

**Rewrite the sentences so that they have a similar meaning and contain the distributive in brackets.**

1. Whenever I tell you to calm down, you snap at me. (every) <InfoTooltip label="Every time I tell you to calm down, you snap at me." />
2. Susan, Megan, Kelly and I got free tickets to the cinema. (each) <InfoTooltip label="Each of us got free tickets to the cinema." />
3. The police searched all the buildings in the neighbourhood. (every) <InfoTooltip label="The police searched every building in the neighbourhood." />
4. Different people like different things. (each) <InfoTooltip label="To each his own." />
5. I was looking for you everywhere! And all of our friends were trying to reach you too! (each) <InfoTooltip label="Each of our friends was trying to reach you too!" />
