Prepositions of place are used to show the position or location of one thing with another. We usually use prepositions of place when we answer the question beginning with "Where?".

> _**Where** do you live? - I live **in** New York._

There are three main prepositions of place:

- **at** -- denotes specific point or location of something.

> - _There's someone standing **at** the door._ (specific location)
> - _There weren't many people **at** the theatre. It's Monday after all._ (specific location)
> - _Alex lives at number 25 Emerald Street._ (address)
> - _Ashley works **at** Apple._ (company or workplace)

- **in** -- implies that something is located in an enclosed space or within a larger area.

> - _I think I left my phone **in** the living-room._ (the living-room is part of your house)
> - _Jake lives **in** the U.S. He lives **in** Texas._ (country, state etc.)

- **on** -- implies that something is located on the surface.

> - _Could you grab my phone? It's on the coffee table in the living-room._ (the surface of furniture.)
> - _Jake's sister is **on** the west coast. She absolutely loves the Pacific!_ (position along a road, river or by the sea, lake etc.)
> - _Alex lives **on** the 3rd floor._ (the floor in the building)
> - _Sorry, I'll call you back. I'm **on** the train now._ (public transport)
> - _My grandparents work **on** a farm._ (open fields = the surface of the earth)

Sometimes you can use both `at` and `in` when you talk about the location, although there is a slight difference in meaning. Study the following examples:

> - _My siblings are **at** the mall now._ (You are stating the location in general. Your sibilngs could be inside the mall, somewhere at the entrance, or at the parking lot.)
> - _My siblings are **in** the mall now._ (You are specifying that your siblings are inside the mall building.)

## Guided Practice

**Use prepositions of place when you answer the question beginning with "Where?".**

- Where do you live? - I live .................... Paris. But right now, I'm living .................... Madrid for a couple of weeks. <InfoTooltip label="I live in Paris. But right now I'm living in Madrid for a couple of weeks." />

**Use _at_ to denote specific point or location of something. Use _in_ when something is located in an enclosed space or within a larger area.**

- As you know, my sister Mary works .................... Apple. She really likes it there as she doesn't work .................... a tiny cubicle but .................... an open space office instead. Mary says it boosts her creativity. <InfoTooltip label="As you know, my sister Mary works at Apple. She really likes it there as she doesn't work in a tiny cubicle but in an open space office instead." />

**Use _in_ when something is located in an enclosed space or within a larger area. Use _on_ when something is located on the surface.**

- I can't believe there is so much storage space .................... the closet. And look at these cute pillows .................... the bed. And there are even flowers .................... the vase .................... the windowsill. This room is just lovely! <InfoTooltip label="I can't believe there is so much storage space in the closet. And look at these cute pillows on the bed. And there are even flowers in the vase on the windowsill." />
