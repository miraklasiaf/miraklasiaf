Prepositions of time are used to denote specific time periods. We usually use prepositions of time when we answer the question beginning with "When?".

> _**When** did you move to New York? - I moved there in 2007._

There are three main prepositions of time:

- **at** -- denotes precise time.

> - _I'll pick you up **at** 5._
> - _We're all going to be sleeping **at** midnight._

Note that `at` is also used with such expressions as `at night`, `at weekend`, `at Christmas`, `at the moment`, `at present`, `at the same time`.

> _Mr. Ruffus isn't available **at** the moment. May I take a message?_

- **on** -- used for days and dates.

> - _I'm meeting up with my friends **on** Saturday. And **on** Sunday Morning I'm flying to Seattle._
> - _Mike has the project presentation **on** 11 November._
> - _My family does nothing **on** Christmas Day._

- **in** -- denotes longer period of time like months, years, centuries etc.

> - _The Parkers are moving to Greece **in** March._
> - _The story is set **in** the 80s._
> - _Life **in** Middle Ages wasn't like in a fairy tale. I don't know how people lived **in** the past!_

Note that `in` is also used with such phrases as `in the morning`/`afternoon`/`evening`.

> - _Theo is an owl. He has a hard time getting up **in** the mornings._

Note that we do not use prepositions before `last`/`next`/`every`/`this`

> _~~I guess we'll see Alice on next Monday.~~ I guest we'll see Alice **next** Monday_

## Guided Practice

**Use _at_ to denote precise time. Use _on_ for days and dates.**

- Should I wake up you .................... 6 .................... 1 January? - Absolutely not! Why would you even do that? - I just figured that if you start celebrating New Year .................... 11 p.m., you should be still up .................... that hour. <InfoTooltip label="at, on, at, at" />

**Use _on_ for days and dates. Use _in_ for longer periods of time.**

- .................... my free time I like yo go to bars and listen to bands there. For example, I went to see the Ribzz performing .................... Sunday evening. It was simply amazing! Too bad that I had to work .................... Monday and I couldn't stay for too long that night. <InfoTooltip label="In, on, on" />

**Use _in_ such phrases as _in the morning_/_afternoon_/_evening_. Do not use prepositions before _last_/_next_/_every_/_this_.**

- Clark usually takes a shower .................... the morning and .................... the evening. But .................... this week he is taking a shower three or four times a day. It's an unusually hot summer! <InfoTooltip label="in, in, (-)" />

## Short Story using Prepositions of Time

-_What does your summer look like?_

-_Well, I have my exams **in** June. I'll be studying **in** the mornings, **in** the afternoons, **in** the evenings..._

-_And **at** nights?_

-_No, not **at** nights. Nights are for sleeping only! I try not to mess up with my sleep schedule._

-_That's a smart decision!_

-_Thanks! Then **in** a couple of weeks I'll be backpacking with my friends. We haven't done it in such a long time. And **on** 4 July I'll be at my parents`._
