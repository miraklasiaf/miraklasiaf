A preposition is usually a short word used to link nouns, pronouns, or phrases to other words within a sentence.

> _If I'm not mistaken, her birthday is **in** May._

Prepositions do not change their form.

Prepositions can consist of one, two, or more words.

> - _Josh went **to** the club **instead of** studying for his exams._

Prepositions can be divided into the following categories:

- **prepositions of place** state the positions or location of one thing with another.

> _Kate works **at** Starbucks._

- **prepositions of time** denote specific time periods.

> _We usually go to our relatives **at** Christmas._

- **prepositions of direction** or motion indicate movement from one place to the other.

> _There's a great pub **across** the street._

- **prepositions of manner** express the manner in which something is done.

## Independent Practice

**Spot prepositions in the following text.**

He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed up him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck.

...

Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown. [Ulysses by James Joyce]
