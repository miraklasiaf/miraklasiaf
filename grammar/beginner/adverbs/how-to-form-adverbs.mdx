An adverb is a word or set of words that modifies verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Usually adverbs modify verbs, telling us how, how often, when, or where something was done.

> _We walked **really slowly**._

In most cases, an adverb is formed by adding `-ly` to an adjective.

> slow → _slowly_

Adverbs formed from adjectives ending in `-l` have double l.

> careful → _carefully_

if the adjective ends in `-able`, `ible`, or `-le`, replace the `-e` with `-y`.

> - probable → _probably_
> - terrible → _terribly_
> - gentle → _gently_

if the adjective ends in `ic`, add `-ally`. There is an exception: public - publicly.

> economic → _economically_

Adjectives that end in `-ly`, such as `friendly` or `lively`, can't be made into adverbs by adding `-ly`. We can use `in a friendly way/manner` instead.

> _He talked to me **in a friendly manner**._

The following adverbs have the same form as the adjectives: `early`, `fast`, `hard`, `high`, `late`, `near`, `straight`, `wrong`.

> - _The train is very **fast**._ (adjective)
> - _The train goes **fast**._ (adverb)

Note that the adverb `well` corresponds to the adjective `good`.

> _Tom is a **good** student. He studies **well**._

Note that the adverb `hardly` is not related to the meaning of hard. The adverb `hardly` has the meaning `almost not`.

> - _**Hardly** anyone writes to me these days._ (=Almost no one writes to me these days.)
> - _Susan ate **hardly** anything._ (=Susan ate almost nothing.)

## Guided Practice

**adj + _-ly_; adj ending in -l + _-ly_; adj ending in -y → _-i_ + _-ly_; adj ending in _-able/-ible/-le_ → replace _-e_ with _-y_; adj ending in _-ic_ + _-ally_. **

- quick → .................... <InfoTooltip label="quickly" />
- angry → .................... <InfoTooltip label="angrily" />
- happy → .................... <InfoTooltip label="happily" />
- comfortable → .................... <InfoTooltip label="comfortably" />
- beautiful → .................... <InfoTooltip label="beautifully" />
- simple → .................... <InfoTooltip label="simply" />
- faithful → .................... <InfoTooltip label="faithfully" />
- calm → .................... <InfoTooltip label="calmly" />
- romantic → .................... <InfoTooltip label="romantically" />
- incredible → .................... <InfoTooltip label="incredibly" />

**Adjectives ending in _-ly_, such as _friendly_ or _lively_\*, can't be made into adverbs by adding _-ly_. Use `in a friendly way/manner` instead.**

- ~~Robin was speaking friendly~~. <InfoTooltip label="Robin was speaking in friendly way/manner." />

**The following adverbs have the same form as the adjectives: `early`, `fast`, `hard`, `high`, `late`, `near`, `straight`, `wrong`.**

- Peter is a **late** boomer. (adjective)
- The train arrived **late**. (adverb)

**The adverb `hardly` is not related to the meaning of hard. It has the meaning `almost not`.**

- There was very little traffic. <InfoTooltip label="There was hardly any traffic" />
