Adverbs of time tell us when an action happened, for how long, or how often. Adverbs of time are invariable.

> _Sorry, I'll call you **in a minute**._

Adverbs of time are usually placed at the end of the sentence.

> _I'll do it **tomorrow**._

Sometimes these adverbs can be put at the beginning of the sentence to give a different emphasis.

> _**Later** they noticed his absence._

In the adverbial phrases that tell us for how long something has been happening, `for` is always followed by an expression of duration, while `since` is always followed by an expression of a point in time.

> - _They'll be away **for twenty days**_.
> - _I haven't seen you **since June**!_

Adverbs that tell us how often something happens express the frequency of an action. They are usually placed before the main verb but after auxiliary verbs (such as `to have`, `may`, `must`).

> - _Sarah **usually** wakes up at **7 a.m.**_
> - _You must **always** be kind to others._

The only exception is when the main verb is `to be`, in which case the adverb goes after the main verb.

> - _I am **never** late._

If you need to use more than one adverb of time in a sentence, use them in the following order:

1. how long
2. how often
3. when

> _Peter worked at the mall for **4 days every week last year**._

## Guided Practice

**Use adverbs of time to show when an action happened or for how long it has been happening. PLace these adverbs at the end of the sentence.**

- (`Why`,`yesterday`,`you`,`to be absent`). <InfoTooltip label="Why were you absent yesterday?" />

**Sometimes adverbs of time can be put at the beginning of the sentence to give a different emphasis.**

- (`James`,`to realise`,`soon`,`that he`, `to make a mistake`). <InfoTooltip label="Soon James realised that he made a mistake" />

**The adverbial phrases that tell us for how long something has been happening, _for_ is always followed by an expression of duration, while _since_ is always followed by an expression of a point in time.**

- I've been waiting for you .................... an hour! <InfoTooltip label="I've been waiting for you for an hour!" />

- Bill has been trying to find a job .................... May! <InfoTooltip label="Bill has been trying to find a job since May!" />

**Place adverbs that tell us how often something happens before the main verb but after auxiliary verbs. If there is a verb _to be_, then the adverb goes after the main verb.**

- (`We`, `to buy`, `groceries`, `often`, `together`). <InfoTooltip label="We often buy groceries together." />

- (`He`, `to be late`, `usually`, `for classes`). <InfoTooltip label="He is usually late for classes." />

**IF you need to use more than one adverb of time in a sentence, use them in the following order: how long, how often, and when.**

- (`Lily`, `to study`, `every day`, `for 5 hours`, `a month ago`). She had a difficulty exam at university. <InfoTooltip label="Lily studied for 5 hours every day a month ago." />

## Short Story using Adverbs of Time

-_When was the last time you cooked?_

-_I cook **every day** so that must be today!_

-_When was the last time you took a bath?_

-_I don't remember really. I **rarely** take baths. I am more of a shower person._

-_When was the last time you slept it?_

-_Oh, it was about a week ago! It was a wonderful **Sunday**. I woke up **late**, stayed in bed **for a couple of hours** and just enjoyed life._
