Adverbs of place tell us where something happens. They do not modify adjectives or other adverbs.

> _I'm going **back** to school in a month._

The adverb of place, `back` modifies the verb `going`. It tells us where we are going.

Adverbs of place are usually placed after the main verb of after the clause that they modify.

> - _Come **in**!_
> - _Helen looked **around** trying to find a familiar face in the crowd._

Adverbs of place that end in `-where` express the idea of location without specifying a specific location or direction.

> - _I couldn't find my cat **anywhere**._

Adverbs of place that end in `-wards` express movement in a particular direction.

> - _Our dog likes to walk **backwards**_.

`Here` and `there` are common adverbs of place. They give a location relative to the speaker. With verbs of movement, `here` means "towards or with the speaker" and `there` means "away from, or not with the speaker."

> - _You can hang your coat **here**._ (You are standing near a hanger.)
> - _And you can put your shoes **there**._ (You are pointing at the shoes rack. You are not standing near it.)

`Here` and `there` are combined with prepositions to make many common adverbial phrases.

> - _Could you come **over here**?_
> - _What are you going **up there**?_

`Here` and `there` are placed at the beginning of the sentence in exclamations or when emphasis is needed. They are followed by the verb if the subject is a noun or by a pronoun if the subject is a pronoun.

> - _**Here** comes the train!_
> - _**There** it is!_
