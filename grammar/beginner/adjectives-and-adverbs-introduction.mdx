## Adjectives

An adjective is a word or set of words that modifies (i.e. describes) a noun or pronoun. Adjectives may come before or after the word they modify.

> - _This is a **cute** cat._
> - _This cat is **cute**._

Adjectives tell us something about a person or a thing. Adjectives can modify nouns (e.g girl, boy etc.) or pronouns (e.g. we, it etc.).

> - _Lily is **an honest** person._
> - _The movie was **awful**! The plot is simply **boring.**_

There are many pairs of adjectives ending in `-ing` and `-ed`. Remember that if something is `-ing`, it makes you `-ed`.

> - _He is **excited** because the event is **exciting**._
> - _I am **annoyed** because this whole situation is **annoying**._

Sometimes we use two or more adjectives together. Quantity/number and quality/opinion adjectives usually go before fact adjectives.

| article | quantity/number | quality/opinion |         fact         |   noun    |
| :-----: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :------------------: | :-------: |
|    a    |                 |     _nice_      |       _sunny_        | _morning_ |
|         |      _two_      |  _intelligent_  |       _young_        | _ladies_  |
|    a    |                 |   _beautiful_   | _large round wooden_ |  _table_  |

There are times when we use two or more fact adjectives. We put fact adjectives in the following order:

| article |  size  |   age   |  shape  | colour  | material/origin | purpose  |  noun   |
| :-----: | :----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-----: |
|    a    | _big_  |  _old_  | _round_ |         |    _wooden_     |          | _table_ |
|         |        |  _new_  |         | _white_ |                 | _tennis_ | _shoes_ |
|    a    | _tall_ | _young_ |         |         |    _Polish_     |          |  _boy_  |

## Adverbs

An adverb is word or set of words that modifies verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Usually adverbs modify verbs, telling us how, how often, when, or where something was done.

> _We walked really **slowly**._

The adverbs slowly modifies the verb walked, how we walked.

An adverb is a word or set of words that modifies:

a. verbs, telling how, how often, when, or where something was done.

> _The cars drove **fast**._

b. adjectives, making them stronger or weaker.

> _Ann looked **absolutely** amazing!_

c. other adverbs, changing their degree or precision.

> _You're speaking **too** loudly._

## Guided Practice

**When forming an adjective note that if something is _-ing_, it makes you _-ed_.**

- (tiredness) This work is so .................... ! It makes me really ..................... <InfoTooltip label="This work is so tiring! It makes me really tired." />
- When we were younger we .................... make friends in 1 second. <InfoTooltip label="could" />

**Quantity/number and quality/opinion adjectives go before fact adjectives.**

- (gorgeous, three) models were in the ad on TV. <InfoTooltip label="Three gorgeous models were in the ad on TV" />
- We asked them to get (wooden, comfy, six) chairs. <InfoTooltip label="We asked them to get six comfy wooden chairs." />

**The order of fact adjectives: size, age, shape, colour, material/origin, purpose.**

- Tim needs (black, new, leather) shoes. <InfoTooltip label="Tim needs new black leather shoes." />
- I'd like to buy an (wooden, round, white, antique) table. <InfoTooltip label="I'd like to buy an antique round white wooden table" />

**Use adverbs to modify verbs, indicating how, how often when, or where something was done. Choose these adverbs.**

- I try to go to quickly to coffee shops every month. <InfoTooltip label="quickly" />

**Use advebs to modify adjectives, making them stronger or weaker, or other adverbs, changing their degree or precision. Choose these adverbs.**

- This game was insanely popular in the 90s. <InfoTooltip label="insanely" />
